Created a new font "Clock5x7.h" which includes all symbols from the changed "System5x7" font,  
new Symbols for an BlockClock Watchface and an Bell Symbol which looks like an Rocket.  
You need to modify the original "allFonts.h" file and add an "#include "Clock5x7.h".  
See https://i.imgur.com/vHU6aPZ.jpg  
Changes on "System5x7" can be reverted by the original file if you use the new Font file.

Replace the system5x7 font with the one here.  
Characters 123-127 showing a small battery,  
Character 91/93 very little PM/AM's symbols.
